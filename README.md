Data Preprocessing

This code performs essential cleaning and transformation steps on raw data to prepare it for machine learning algorithms. Raw data often contains inconsistencies, errors, and irrelevant information that can hinder a model's performance.  Here, we aim to:

Clean the data: This involves handling missing values, outliers, inconsistencies, and typos.
Transform the data: This might include scaling numerical features, encoding categorical features, and feature engineering to create new relevant features.
Validate the data: This step ensures the data is in a format suitable for the chosen machine learning algorithm.
Benefits of Data Preprocessing:

Improved model performance: Clean and well-formatted data leads to more accurate predictions and efficient learning by machine learning models.
Reduced training time: Data preprocessing helps algorithms converge faster during training.
Enhanced model interpretability: By understanding the transformations applied, it becomes easier to interpret the model's results.
Note: This repository focuses on the data preprocessing stage commonly used in various machine learning pipelines.
